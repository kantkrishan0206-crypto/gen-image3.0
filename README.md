## 🔹 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Model Type** | Native Multimodal Image Generation Model using a unified autoregressive framework, integrating text and image data deeply. |
| **Scale** | Largest open-source image generation model to date: 80B parameters (13B activated per token during inference) with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. |
| **Reasoning** | World-Knowledge Reasoning: intelligently interprets sparse prompts using common sense and contextual knowledge. |
| **Prompt Understanding** | Supports ultra-long text input (>1,000 characters) for precise control over complex scenes. |
| **Text Rendering** | Excels at rendering text within images (titles, logos, annotations, multilingual text). |
| **Commercial Use** | First open-source commercial-grade multimodal image generation model. Free for developers and enterprises (with license restrictions). |

## 💻 System Requirements

Due to its massive size and MoE architecture, running the full model requires high-end hardware:

- **GPU Memory:** ≥3x 80GB VRAM (4x 80GB recommended, e.g., NVIDIA A100/H100)
- **Disk Space:** 170GB for model weights
- **Operating System:** Linux with CUDA 12.8

> ⚠️ This is a major, real-world, fully functioning AI model. Not suitable for low-spec machines.

## 🧠 Why Gen-Image3.0 is a Big Deal

- **Largest Open-Source Model:** 80 billion parameters make it highly capable.  
- **Intelligent Reasoning:** Can fill in missing details intelligently (e.g., "19th-century schoolroom" will include historically accurate objects).  
- **Superior Understanding:** Handles very long, complex instructions.  
- **Accurate Text Rendering:** Can generate text accurately inside images, which many AI models struggle with.  
- **Open-Source:** Code and weights are publicly available for modification and commercial use.
