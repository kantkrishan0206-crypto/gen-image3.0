## ðŸ“– Introduction
**gen-image3.0** is a state-of-the-art AI model that generates high-quality images from textual descriptions. It uses a **unified autoregressive multimodal framework**, meaning it deeply understands both text and image data to create visually compelling outputs.  

In simple words:
- **What it is:** An AI model that turns text prompts into images.  
- **Who made it:** Your team (inspired by open-source breakthroughs).  
- **Why it matters:** Itâ€™s large, intelligent, accurate in rendering details (including text), and fully open-source for commercial use.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Unified Multimodal Architecture:** Integrates text and image modalities for contextually rich image generation.
- **Largest Open-Source Image Generation Model:** ~80 billion parameters with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design (13B active per token).
- **World-Knowledge Reasoning:** Can intelligently fill missing details using common sense.
- **Ultra-Long Prompt Understanding:** Handles text prompts over 1,000 characters for fine-grained scene control.
- **Accurate Text Rendering:** Supports precise generation of titles, logos, annotations, and multilingual text.
- **Commercial Use:** Fully open-source for developers and businesses (some geographic restrictions may apply).

## ðŸ’» System Requirements
Due to its size, gen-image3.0 requires high-end hardware:

- **GPU Memory:** â‰¥3 Ã— 80GB VRAM (4 Ã— 80GB recommended, e.g., NVIDIA A100/H100)  
- **Disk Space:** 170GB for model weights  
- **Operating System:** Linux with CUDA 12.8
